					<h4> Spiderman Into The Spiderverse</h4>
					<p> Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that there are many others who share his special, high-flying talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world.</p>

				 <td> Spiderman Into the spiderverse was one of my favorite movies when it released. The line that resonates with me the most in the film was, <strong> How am I gonna know if i'll mess it up? You won't because it's a leap of faith. </strong> I believe that message that was presented throughout the film is an amazing way to encourage the audience to follow their gut and to take risks in life that matter to our core.</td>

				 	<h4> Marriage Story</h4> 
				 	<p> A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a gruelling, coast-to-coast divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes.</p>
				 </td>
				 <td> Adam Driver, Scarlet Johansson, Azhy Robertson.
				 	  Noah Baumbach </td>
					<td> Marriage Story is a very sad drama that pains me to watch. The movie is very realistic with its themes of divorce, abandonment, and love. Firstly, I'd love to commend the actors for being on their A-game and putting in the most effort. Because it truly shows in their scenes. The scene I wanted to mention the most is the arguement scene between Adam Driver and Scarlet Johannson. It shows a realistic fight between the couple, Adam driver struggling, and stuettering his words while arguing with his spouse is realistic and makes the film very human. </td>

					<h4> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3</h4>
					<p> Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team to defend the universe and protect one of their own. If the mission is not completely successful, it could possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. </p>
				</td>
				<td>  Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillian, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementiff. 
				 James Gunn</td>
				<td> In this movie, we follow Rocket Raccoon's origin story. You might think this is some normal movie about him turning into a hero, but as we realize Rocket's backstory, we see how <strong> tragic</strong> his past is. He was just a normal raccon but he was picked apart, turned into a cyber-netic robot, and abused. I didn't realize how dark and tragic he was, but that just made me resonate with Rocket even more. I think the true high in this movie is Rocket's acceptance of his past, and moving forward in his life. Which truly shows how strong he is now. </td>
				<td> 5.0 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</td>
